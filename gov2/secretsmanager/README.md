# AWS SDK for Go V2 code examples for AWS Secrets Manager

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Secrets Manager
operations using version 2 of the AWS SDK for Go.

AWS Secrets Manager helps you to securely encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials for your databases and other services.

## Code Examples

The following examples are included:

-   Create a secret
-   Get the value of a secret
-   Change the value of the secret
-   List secrets in your account
-   Delete a secret

## Running the code

To run the full example suite, enter:

```
go run main.go
```

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
configured as described in
[Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html)
in the AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide.

### Important!

-   We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
    or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
    For more information, see
    [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
    in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
-   This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
    Some AWS services are available only in specific
    [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
-   Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

# Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/picante-io/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
